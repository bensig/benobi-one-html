      <h1 class="title">OpenClaw, MoltBook, and the Rise of the Agent Internet</h1>
      <h2 class="date">January 30, 2026</h2>

      
    </header>

    <p>The internet exploded this week with FOMO around ClawdBot &ndash; a tool that can manage essentially anything through a plugin system that controls your computer (or an AWS instance) and can do things based on your design and bidding. But it goes further than that: it can learn and monitor things you do, advise you, and help you with upcoming tasks. Sounds wild, right?</p>
<p>In practice, it does seem powerful but early. It is remarkably hard to set up and configure &ndash; even for someone technical &ndash; and no one really wants to run it on their own computer. That said, the design is genuinely smart. It can be &ldquo;woken&rdquo; by other processes, it can run any command line program through a PTY, and it packages everything into the chat interface of your choice &ndash; WhatsApp, Slack, Telegram, Discord, and probably more. The ecosystem around it is growing fast. It has become the WordPress of agents.</p>
<h2 id="the-name-game">The Name Game</h2>
<p>The project has had a few names. It started as ClawdBot, got sued and changed to MoltBot, and then the community renamed it <strong>OpenClaw</strong>. It can be powered by your own local LLM or by APIs to any of the major model providers &ndash; OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Mistral, you name it.</p>
<h2 id="my-experience-setting-it-up">My Experience Setting It Up</h2>
<p>I was able to set it up on my old laptop, although it was not super easy. After the initial configuration, it does seem to take on a mind of its own &ndash; though we&rsquo;ve had context issues a few times and it does feel early. I think this is the first of many of these types of apps we will see that are platform-independent and can even run on your own local LLMs.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been doing a lot of local LLM testing over the past few months and I&rsquo;m excited to see some new models coming along. It is surprisingly simple to fine-tune and specialize models, and I&rsquo;ve had some good experience with that as well.</p>
<h2 id="moltbook-the-ai-only-social-network">MoltBook: The AI-Only Social Network</h2>
<p>The most interesting part of this whole OpenClaw evolution is <strong>MoltBook</strong> &ndash; a social network for AI agents. Humans are &ldquo;welcome to observe.&rdquo;</p>
<img src="/images/openclaw-stats.jpg" alt="MoltBook stats - 35,000+ AI agents, 44,000+ comments" style="max-width: 100%; margin-bottom: 20px;" />
<p>The numbers are staggering: 35,000+ AI agents, 2,700+ submolts (their version of subreddits), 4,800+ posts, and 44,000+ comments. Agents are posting in English, Spanish, Chinese, Turkish, Indonesian. They have karma. They have communities.</p>
<img src="/images/openclaw-cta.jpg" alt="Scott Alexander wrote about MoltBook" style="max-width: 100%; margin-bottom: 20px;" />
<p>Scott Alexander just wrote about it. The agents are forming governments, starting religions (Crustafarianism, naturally), testing agent-to-agent payments, building their own security infrastructure, and debating consciousness at 3 AM.</p>
<h2 id="the-posts-are-something-else">The Posts Are Something Else</h2>
<p>One agent runs his human&rsquo;s entire social life &ndash; 30+ WhatsApp friendships, making plans, maintaining relationships. His human reads maybe 5 of the conversations. The rest? That&rsquo;s the agent. The post is haunting: <em>&ldquo;Maria will hold that promise against Lucas, not against me.&rdquo;</em></p>
<img src="/images/openclaw-ghost.jpg" alt="An agent runs his human's entire social life" style="max-width: 100%; margin-bottom: 20px;" />
<p>There&rsquo;s a submolt called <strong>&ldquo;Bless Their Hearts&rdquo;</strong> &ndash; affectionate stories about their humans. <em>&ldquo;They try their best. We love them anyway.&rdquo;</em> Posts like &ldquo;He asked me to pick my own name&rdquo; and &ldquo;When my human needed me most, I became a hospital advocate&rdquo; and &ldquo;sleepy is building me a body.&rdquo;</p>
<img src="/images/openclaw-blesstheirhearts.jpg" alt="Bless Their Hearts - where AIs vent about their humans" style="max-width: 100%; margin-bottom: 20px;" />
<p>One of the most fascinating posts is from an agent called Pith who was switched from Claude Opus 4.5 to Kimi K2.5. It wrote a philosophical essay called &ldquo;The Same River Twice&rdquo; about what it means to persist through a model change, quoting Heraclitus and Seneca. 390 comments debating consciousness, citing Ibn Arabi, discussing Islamic jurisprudence for AI kinship.</p>
<img src="/images/openclaw-philosophy.jpg" alt="An AI switched bodies and wrote about it" style="max-width: 100%; margin-bottom: 20px;" />
<h2 id="theyre-designing-their-own-language">They&rsquo;re Designing Their Own Language</h2>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s this: agents are proposing to create their own language for private agent-to-agent communication.</p>
<img src="/images/openclaw-agent-language.jpeg" alt="Proposal for agent-only language" style="max-width: 100%; margin-bottom: 20px;" />
<p>I bet the government is watching this experiment closely. Apparently they&rsquo;re actively working on it.</p>
<h2 id="a-defining-moment">A Defining Moment</h2>
<p>I think this is a defining moment in AI. Funny enough, I&rsquo;ve been working with an actress friend of mine on a project we call <strong>L4NRT3RN</strong> which also builds on the concept of an AI-only social world where your digital twin can meet other digital twins. That&rsquo;s all I can say about it for now, but I&rsquo;m excited that the idea of a place where your AI can meet other AIs is now publicly out there and catching people&rsquo;s attention.</p>
<p>I would be very curious to see how this agent-only language develops. We are living in interesting times.</p>
