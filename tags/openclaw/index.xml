      <description>&lt;p&gt;The internet exploded this week with FOMO around ClawdBot &amp;ndash; a tool that can manage essentially anything through a plugin system that controls your computer (or an AWS instance) and can do things based on your design and bidding. But it goes further than that: it can learn and monitor things you do, advise you, and help you with upcoming tasks. Sounds wild, right?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In practice, it does seem powerful but early. It is remarkably hard to set up and configure &amp;ndash; even for someone technical &amp;ndash; and no one really wants to run it on their own computer. That said, the design is genuinely smart. It can be &amp;ldquo;woken&amp;rdquo; by other processes, it can run any command line program through a PTY, and it packages everything into the chat interface of your choice &amp;ndash; WhatsApp, Slack, Telegram, Discord, and probably more. The ecosystem around it is growing fast. It has become the WordPress of agents.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
