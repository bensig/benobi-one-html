# Lessig Method

*“Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication” - LDV*

For highly impactful presentation formatting and delivery in a very clean and professional style, I recommend reading about the "Lessig Method" by famous Harvard Law professor Lawrence Lessig: https://presentationzen.blogs.com/presentationzen/2005/10/the_lessig_meth.html

Most of his slides have only one word on them. He's a human with superhuman intellect and a great internet advocate and activist who founded Stanford's Center for Internet and Society.

This guy is an absolute legend. You can also see videos of his presentations on his website https://lessig.org/media/
