Despite the great gap that the media likes to paint between the US and China, the Beijing-based TikTok app has users from both countries - and just about everywhere in-between - connected. 

TikTok is an interesting platform, it started as Musical.ly - an app that made it simple for users to record lip synch videos. Musical.ly itself was [actually a pivot from an educational video platform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical.ly). This is a great testament to perseverance and continuous ingenuity.

## Vine, is clearly a predecessor to TikTok. What did they have in common? 

* Short-form skit videos that are addictive and viral - check. 
* Tons of youth making videos and sharing them - check. 
* People posting videos from here on other platforms - check. 

In January of 2020, the [founder of Vine returned to launch a TikTok-competitor / Vine-reboot called Byte](https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/25/tech/byte-app-tiktok-vine/index.html). I have not used it yet, but I do plan to check it out soon.

## TikTok Timing

People say that "timing is everything" - I would say that it's definitely important, but clearly not everything. Timing is one of the most important aspects of building anything. Let's explore a bit of why the timing of TikTok worked, and Vine did not.

TikTok works because it's fresh. It's not full of the same people doing the same things. Once it becomes that, people will crave something else new. As great as the algorithms are on Facebook and Instagram, they will not feel as fresh as a new app. When Vine was first released, Instgram was the rising star... hard to compete with that sort of starpower. Now that starpower is TikTok.

Talking about timing, coronavirus has leveled the playing field for content creators. You don't need a studio any more to compete with Jimmy Fallon. You and him are both making videos from your living room. 

Meanwhile, everyone else is on lockdown at home looking for new ways to experience the outside world, and looking for new things to do... so TikTok is at the right place at the right time. Speaking of places, TikToks are literally everywhere. I even saw that dude with a sign was protesting for people to "[Keep TikToks on Tiktok](https://knowyourmeme.com/photos/1762226-dude-with-sign)."
 
## TikTok Sharing: Reposts

The sharability of TikTok is very smartly done. It's a bit counterintuitive at first for an app creator to want users to consume content outside of their app. Most apps want users (and the content) to stay inside of the app as much as possible. Screen time and recurring screen time are important metrics for apps to measure traction. TikTok links unfurl nicely into any other app or message where you can watch the video in the context of another app, webpage, or message. Anyone can also download the TikToks and repost them elsewhere. Smartly, each TikTok includes a little watermark to let you know who made the video (so you can follow their handle on) TikTok. It's working. I saw so many TikToks that I finally decided to download the app again last week (I had previously downloaded and deleted.)

After downloading TikTok again, I realized that the sharability - the portability of the content can be more powerful than trying to lock users into an app. The wide sharing of TikToks on Facebook and Instagram is a Trojan Horse. Content from TikTok ends up on all of my friends' Facebook and Instagram stories... and then, boom, I download the app again uninstalling it months ago...  Unlike Vine, [instead of being killed by Instagram video](https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/28/13456208/why-vine-died-twitter-shutdown) - TikTok is using Instagram (and Facebook) video to grow. Therefore, it's not just timing - but simple factors like this which make a difference in an app's potential to become a killer app.
