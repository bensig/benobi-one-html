In consumer tech products, the holy grail is often referred to as the "killer app." Of course, in this phrase "killer" means that an app will break the mold and have hockey-stick levels of adoption and user activity. This leads many to ponder the question...

### What is the formula for a killer app? 

Well, there is a man who wrote a formula. I am grateful to have spent some time with Eyal Herzog over the past two years. He is a brilliant guy who is obsessed with killer apps. Eyal has been building products for almost 40 years. Before co-founding Bancor, way back in the early days of the internet, he built Contact.com (a precursor to LinkedIn that raised $50M in the early days of the internet) and he also built MetaCafe (a popular video platform that was precursor to YouTube). 

Eyal made [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_tY_paH4-k) about the evolution from 2-tier to 3-tier ecosystems with the growth of the superuser. Essentially, his thesis is that superusers are the ones who create and curate content. It's a very interesting perspective about the evolution of online products as it relates to capabilities of the platforms. The most powerful concept of this video is his formula for mass adoption (aka "killer app"). 

His formula is: `Killer App = low cost of failure +  high value of success + free marketing` Let's break this down a little bit. 

### Low Cost of Failure

What this means is that users must be able to test out an application quickly (low cost in time) and cheaply (low cost in money). Users have almost no patience at all, so an app has to have the lowest possible barriers for users to be able to experiment at success on a platform. We cannot change the likelihood of failure, but we can lower it's cost. Additionally, a good app can integrate even a single small contribution into the value offering of the app itself. 

Take Reddit for example - you can be a moderator of a thread, submit a link, comment on links, or simply vote on links or comments up or down. Even a simple task builds value on the platform in numbers. Eventually, those little upvotes add up to one of the most powerful and most visited sites on the web.

### High Value of Success

Secondly, that success must be valuable. If it's not clear what success looks like and what it's value is - then why would I try to use your app at all?

### Free Marketing

Apps build ecosystems when users generate content and the platform helps promote that content to other users - thus makking Eyal's "superusers" even more super. This benefits the app because it increases engagement and rewards people who are able to create and maintain engagement. 

Bringing it all together, the formula for the killer app can be summarized - make it easy and quick for people to experiment at what it takes to win on your app, and show them what prizes they will get for winning. The juice has to be worth the squeeze. I'm sure that this might seem really obvious to some people, but you would be surprised how many apps get funding and years of people's time without having this figured out! 

Building the killer app is a battle for the attention of users. Every time a user picks up their smartphone and opens an app - a developer somewhere is grateful. It's one of the most important metrics for app developers - Daily Active Users (DAU). For users, protecting their time is important since that is our most valuable asset. But it doesn't take much time. For apps, winning a few minutes of millions of user's time and attention can be worth billions.
