JP Barlow is one of the internet's greatest heroes. The Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace is a really special document to me. I think I teared up a little bit when I first read it. There are many people who do not feel at home where they are physically. Ultimately, what makes the internet beatiful is a collection of connections between the ideas of people. That is how I interpret Barlow's concept of cyberspace being the "new home of Mind." The internet's only limitation is the capacity for minds to imagine and to build.
