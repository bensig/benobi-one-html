### TL,DR
Ben Sigman is the CEO of [Bitcoin Libre](https://www.bitcoinlibre.io) building a simple wallet for Bitcoin and Tether. He is also an advisor to the [Bitcoin Foundation](https://bitcoinfoundation.org/) and a founding member of [United Council of Rising Nations](https://unicorn.org) where he is working on [diplomacy and advocacy for Bitcoin and cryptoassets](https://benobi.one/initiatives/) in the developing world. 

He believes in human-centric technologies that provide transparency, data control, and alignment among all participants through tokenized systems and incentives. He has been working in technology for over 20 years as a systems engineer, developer, and entreprenuer. His mission is to create freedom, privacy, and fun in the universe - and of course, to defeat the [Galactic Empire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXf4ijlTOgQ).

Building and teaching others about technology has been a lifelong passion and he continues to immerse himself deeply into these incredible projects.

It is built using [Hugo]( {{< relref "posts/hugo_deployment_to_github" >}})... A jedi must always be learning new tricks.
