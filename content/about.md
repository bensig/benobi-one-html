## About the name

Benobi was a nickname given to me by my girlfriend back in 2016 - which really stuck because of my awareness and my calm, zen-like approach to problem solving. I was doing a lot of self-work during the 2015-2016 time period. The training has paid off... as a wise person once said, the best investment is to invest in ourselves.

## About this site 

This is a site to showcase some of the things I have been working on for the past few years. 

I decided to build it using Hugo since it seemed like something fun and new to learn... A jedi must always be learning new tricks. 

I am planning to use this site to share some of my thoughts about different things I am interested in.
