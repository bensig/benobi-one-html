## 2020 - [Retro Ping](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/retro-ping-wifi-latency-test/id1505266057?ls=1)

{{% portfolio image="/images/retro-ping.gif" link="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/retro-ping-wifi-latency-test/id1505266057?ls=1"  alt="retro ping" %}}

In quarantine, I found myself constantly testing my internet latency to see where my connectivity was good or bad during the constant Zoom conferences. I decided to build a very simple app to help myself and others test their connections... with a retro vaporwave theme. The MVP is live on the [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/retro-ping-wifi-latency-test/id1505266057?ls=1).

I have been considering various ways to monetize the app. I plan to continue to provide the app for free... or less people would download and use it. Retro Ping was built in Swift and it has no backend servers, so it is very low cost to maintain. I have been making some posts about building the process of building this over on the [blog]({{< ref "/posts" >}}).

## 2019 - [Sense (EOS) Chat](https://www.sense.chat)

{{% portfolio image="/images/eos-chat.png" alt="eos mainnet" link="https://www.sense.chat"%}}

I joined as the CTO of Sense Chat - a decentralized messaging app built on the EOS blockchain. The beta app is live on the [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.makesense.sensechat&hl=en_GB) and [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sense-chat/id1434117290).

EOS Chat leverages blockchain for accounts, authentication, [encryption](https://medium.com/sensechat/sense-chat-tech-c91295caf632), and allows users to send tokens to one another with no middle man. It does not require a phone number to use, therefore it is entirely pseudonymous.

## 2018 - [EOS](http://eosacknowledgments.io)

{{% portfolio image="/images/eos.png" alt="eos mainnet" link="<http://eosacknowledgments.io"%}}>

I was called in to be a part of the community leadership for EOS Mainnet launch in 2018. I worked closely with the ghostbusters team on network architecture and security. I also wrote tutorials and articles about the launch and function of the network and worked on organizing the community of block producers and coordinating feedback with Block.One.

You can see my name with all of the other major contributors at <http://eosacknowledgments.io.>

## 2018 - [Squirrel](https://getsquirrel.io/)

{{% portfolio image="/images/get-squirrel.png" alt="squirrel" link="(<https://getsquirrel.io)"%}}>

In April of 2017, while traveling in Japan and tracking my cryptocurrency holdings on a spreadsheet - I had an idea to build a better Blockfolio. We came up with the name Squirrel because they always know where their nuts are located. I did not trust the security and privacy features of Blockfolio and I had some ideas on how it could be done better - by enabling the hodlr to see what holdings they had in which locations. From wireframes to building and launching took about 8 months. The app is available on iOS and Android.

## 2018 - White Rabbit

{{% portfolio image="/images/white-rabbit.png" alt="white rabbit" link="/404.html"%}}

In February of 2018, we launched White Rabbit - an ICO tracking app and news website. We completed the project while working on Squirrel. Using rapid prototyping and leveraging React Native / Rails - from ideation to launch, the app and website were live in about 90 days. The app successfully pushed us into the center of the burgeoning cryptocurrency industry in Los Angeles.

## 2017 - [Avengers](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2974733)

{{% portfolio image="/images/avengers.png" alt="avengers" link="/404.html"%}}

In 2017, I spent 6 months in Atlanta working on a project with codename: "Mary Lou" - one of the largest film productions ever. It was a dual production of Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame. The motion capture team was facing some data transmission and security challenges on the live production, so they asked me to come down and help out for a few months. I got an [IMDB credit](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2974733/) for my work there.

## 2016 - [Hacktic](https://hacktic.net)

{{% portfolio image="/images/hacktic.png" alt="hacktic" link="<https://hacktic.net"%}}>

HACKTIC is a non-profit LAN + educational party called HACKTIC for techie youth to come together to connect and learn basic cryptography and linux hacking skills by playing games and leveling up in their skills. We had several great events in LA during 2016 by partnering with technology teachers in Los Angeles. The goal of the events were to encourage and mentor young techies (such as Kyle) who we could mentor.

## 2015 - WSP

{{% portfolio image="/images/wsp.png" alt="WSP" link="/404.html"%}}

WeSolveProblems was designed as an organization for all of my consultant friends to work together to refer one-another work and also share the branding of an organization of approved vendors who solve all kinds of problems. The company grew mostly in the technology consulting and it acquired my previous IT consulting company - Rent-A-Geek, LA that I had started back in 2006.

## 2014 - Project LOCAL

{{% portfolio image="/images/local_tile.png" alt="Project LOCAL" link="/404.html"%}}

The idea of Project LOCAL is to re-brand the label “Made in America” as “Local" to make “Made in America” cool again… This would be a product database / label schema which would add transparency to where the product materials were sourced and where they were assembled.

Eventually, Project Local will create brick and mortar stores that sold US-produced household goods and goodies – like a Target / Wal-Mart store. However, instead of products made in China, Indonesia, Vietnam… These goods would be entirely produced in the US.

I designed and pitched this idea at an LA-startup pitch competition where I won first place. The judges told me that I was "cool as a cucumber while pitching" which seemed like a great compliment at the time.

## 2014 - [NoLag.Hosting](https://nolag.hosting)

{{% portfolio image="/images/nolag_hosting.png" alt="Nolag.Hosting" link="<https://nolag.hosting"%}}>

[Ashkaan Hassan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashkaan/) and I co-founded [NoLag.Hosting](https://nolag.hosting) with Kyle Manning who was 14 at the time. Kyle wanted to start a hosting company to host VPS systems for game servers. We built out our own rack system with load balancers, power failovers, compute clusters, and storage using open-source hardware and software including pfsense and proxmox. Our datacenter is located downtown LA right across the street from One Wilshire in a [top-notch tier 4 datacenter](https://www.colocationamerica.com/data-center/tier-standards-overview.htm).

[Ashkaan Hassan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashkaan/) and I co-founded a network security company called Bulletproof WiFi which designed and configured firewalls and wireless access points for homes and businesses. As of 2020, the business is still generating monthly recurring revenue and it continues to grow.

## 2013 - [Dice Cam](https://www.benlamjunbin.com/dice.html?fbclid=IwAR10l1f7Xp1vBbhwoXieCZvgxCTbzbwxIGCC4QIqyzR3lsr08fifuxHajR0)

{{% portfolio image="/images/dice-app-screens.png" alt="Dice App" link="[/404.htm](https://www.benlamjunbin.com/dice.html?fbclid=IwAR10l1f7Xp1vBbhwoXieCZvgxCTbzbwxIGCC4QIqyzR3lsr08fifuxHajR0)"%}}

This was the first product I designed back in 2013. Dice was a small camera that could be placed anywhere to produce a "portal" where other people could watch your video stream in the Dice mobile app (UX visible here on the left). The idea was that you could either have a public or private stream. Users would be able to check on their pets, let people tune into their backyard party, or just use it as a security camera in their garage.

The small form factor of the camera is what made it unique - 3 inches by 3 inches. We had industrial designs, but we did not raise any money to build a prototype.

The designer of this project, Ben Lam, is a dope designer and an old friend. He reached out to let me know that he also has Dice on his [portfolio here](https://www.benlamjunbin.com/dice.html?fbclid=IwAR10l1f7Xp1vBbhwoXieCZvgxCTbzbwxIGCC4QIqyzR3lsr08fifuxHajR0).
