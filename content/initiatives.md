There are approximately 2 billion people in the world with no access to a savings account or lacking the proper identification to open a savings account. Due to the nature of modern money - which is controlled and printed by governments - these people have no way to save money for their future in a way that counteracts inflation of money printing machines. 

Bitcoin and cryptoassets are the evolution of 21st century technology to create and govern money supply. Bitcoin is a non-governmental, multinational money that - although nascient - has the potential to transform the way that we measure value. It's sound money - meaning that it holds it's value over time. Bitcoin is also widely adoped, easy to transport and send in a permissionless system, and has a known quantity - there will only be 21 million Bitcoin ever created. Since all you need to hold and transact with Bitcoin is a mobile phone - I believe that this new financial system of cryptoassets built on and around Bitcoin can provide access to financial tools to people all over the world.

This is why I am currently working with [United Council of Rising Nations](https://unicorn.org) and the [Bitcoin Foundation](https://bitcoinfoundation.org) on diplomacy and advocacy for Bitcoin and blockchain adoption, regulation, and tax incentives for innovative businesses to be able to set up operations in these developing nations. Since June 2021, we have met with the governments of El Salavador, Honduras, Panama, Ecuador, and Guatemala.

I have also been working with a multinational DAO to build and promote Bitcoin Libre as a Bitcoin wallet that works anywhere in the world and has the same great user-experience of apps like Cash App or Venmo.
