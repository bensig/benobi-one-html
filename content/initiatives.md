As a Bitcoin advocate and leader, I work with governments worldwide to advance Bitcoin adoption and financial inclusion. Since 2021, I've advised presidents, lawmakers, and central bankers across Latin America on Bitcoin policy and implementation.

## Why Bitcoin Matters

Bitcoin represents financial freedom for the 2 billion people worldwide who lack access to basic banking services. As a non-governmental, fixed-supply currency, Bitcoin offers a way for anyone with a mobile phone to participate in the global economy and protect their savings from inflation.

I lead initiatives to make Bitcoin more accessible through:
- Advising on national Bitcoin legislation and regulation
- Promoting clean energy Bitcoin mining
- Developing [Bitcoin Libre](https://bitcoinlibre.io) - a self-custodied wallet focused on emerging markets

As a representative of the [United Council of Rising Nations](https://unicorn.org) and [Bitcoin Foundation](https://bitcoinfoundation.org), I continue to advocate for Bitcoin adoption, fair regulation, and innovation-friendly policies across developing nations.
